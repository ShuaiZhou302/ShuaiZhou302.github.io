## Philly

<!-- 1. The Hugo Blox website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site
2. The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It's a good platform for anyone looking to take control of their data and online identity whilst having the convenience to start off with a **no-code solution (write in Markdown and customize with YAML parameters)** and having **flexibility to later add even deeper personalization with HTML and CSS**
3. You can work with all your favourite tools and apps with hundreds of plugins and integrations to speed up your workflows, interact with your readers, and much more -->
1. Visit UPenn! I took my first research-level planning course at GRASP LAB—glad to mark my first milestone at the place where it all began!
2. What a biiiiig city! Bro 😩 is too broke to rent a car or scooter, so he got no choice but to rely on his feet 🏃‍. Walked to University City! Walked to the Museum of Art! Walked to the Benjamin Franklin Bridge! Wait, so this is New Jersey? And why are you staring at me 🥧? Bro even got chased by a random homeless person, but luckily, he survived! Reminds me of my old days in Berkeley.
3. Chinatown! It always feels both strange and moving to see familiar-looking people passing by when you're just a stranger wandering in a foreign land. Okay, don’t be too sentimental—remember, our theme is tired.


## AAAI MAIN CONFERENCE

1. Open Reception: Met Rishi and Keisuke in person! Still surprised to find someone who actually understands what my research is about! But the food sucks. 😔
2. Opening Ceremony: Bro fell asleep because of jet lag. 😟
3. Poster Session: Lots of interesting work! Immediate responses are way better than waiting for someone's reply over email. Also met a few members of ARCS Lab + my future advisor—very nice people! Can't wait to see them again in July. Hopefully, everything will work out fine.
4. Oral Presentation: "Okay, so let's spend some quality time together." Eh… what's that about? Anyway, you should definitely go to the oral sessions—amazing slides and animations make understanding others' work way more interesting.
5. Workshop: The industry's needs and perspectives on MAPF are really thought-provoking. What level of work is good enough? What counts as a fake problem? How can MAPF be extended to real-world applications? Bro still has tons of questions, but that’s okay—hopefully, he figures it all out during his PhD (if there is one).


## Short trip at Princeton and Chicago

1. so there are short trips, what do you expect to see here hhh. 
2. Somehow I can calls this campus visit?
