## Philly

<!-- 1. The Hugo Blox website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site
2. The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It's a good platform for anyone looking to take control of their data and online identity whilst having the convenience to start off with a **no-code solution (write in Markdown and customize with YAML parameters)** and having **flexibility to later add even deeper personalization with HTML and CSS**
3. You can work with all your favourite tools and apps with hundreds of plugins and integrations to speed up your workflows, interact with your readers, and much more -->

1. Visit Upenn! I learned my first course about research level planning knowledge from GRASP LAB,  glad to build my first milestone at where i begin!
2. What a Biggggggggggg city! Bro 😩 is too broke to rant any car or scooter, luckily he get his foot 🏃‍. Walk to University city! Walk to museum of art! Walk to benjamin franklin bridge! So here is new jersey？So why you staring at me 🥧？ Bro got chased by random homeless but luckily he survived！Reminds me of my old days in Berkeley.
3. Chinatown！It is always felling both strange and moving to see people looks familiar passing by you when you are a stranger wandering in a foreign land. Ok don't be too sensitive, remember our theme is tired.


## AAAI MAIN CONFERENCE

1. Open reception: meet rishi and keisuke in person! Still suprised to have somebody understanding what my research is about! But the food sucks 😔
2. Open ceremony: Bro fell asleep because of jet lag 😟
3. Poster session: Lots of interesting works! Imeediate response is way much better than waiting for someone's reply in mail. And I meet a few members of ARCS Lab + my future advisor. Very nice people! Can't wait to meet them again in july! Hopefully everything will work out fine.
4. Oral presentation: "Ok so let's spend some quality time together" Eh... what's that about? Anyway you should go to the oral session, amazing slides and animation is most interesting way to understand others' works.
5. Workshop: The industry's needs and opinions on MAPF ​​are thought-provoking. What level of work is sufficient? What is a fake problem? How to extend MAPF to real-world application? Bro still get lots of question but that's ok, hopefully he figures all out during his phd (If there is one).
