      title: 'ðŸ¤– Short summary of my previous and ongoing Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My previous and ongoing projects have all focused on search-based planning methods, aiming to bridge the gap between abstract planning and real-world execution by developing algorithms that account for practical constraints. These include handling agents with heterogeneous speeds (AAAI 2025, SoCS 2025), meeting time-sensitive requirements, and incorporating kinematic constraints (Under Review).
        
        Besides planning, for subsequent research, I want to explore more, as I believe research is motivated by both passion and consistency. There are some potential topics I'd like to explore now:
        (1) Real robot systems, which include humanoid robots and robot dogs. I want to know how to make them robustly perform tasks that we humans find simple but hard for them. Simply put, it's pure curiosity.
        (2) Extending ideas of heuristic search to other related topics (a good example would be MMD, CBS with diffusion models as low-level single agent planners), especially in topics concerning high-dimensional configuration spaces. Design methods that avoid the dimensionality curse caused by enumeration, for example, using patterns learned through machine learning to guide heuristic search planning
