Good to hear from CMU! See u in Pittsburgh! 

This page is to record my summer research application, it may be helpful to friends who apply for summer research in the future.

{{< toc mobile_only=true is_open=true >}}

I applied to official programs or cold emailed professors from the following schools.

## Official Program

- Stanford SURF ❌ Withdrawn: Stanford does not allow stay after summer.
- EPFL E3 ❌ Rejected： Not so match, that's ok for bro


## Cold Mail

- CMU 💤 first cold email  -> Follow up after 1 week -> Interview -> ✅ Offer : Very good match and I have one first-author paper related to the same topic.
- UCI first cold email -> ✅ offer -> 💤 No response: Maybe Prof is too busy hh
- MIT filled the request form -> 💤 No response: Guess bro just not qualified
- Yale first cold email -> 💤 No response: Guess bro is not a good match

<!-- 1. The Hugo Blox website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site
1. The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It's a good platform for anyone looking to take control of their data and online identity whilst having the convenience to start off with a **no-code solution (write in Markdown and customize with YAML parameters)** and having **flexibility to later add even deeper personalization with HTML and CSS**
2. You can work with all your favourite tools and apps with hundreds of plugins and integrations to speed up your workflows, interact with your readers, and much more -->

My friend says: 👉 Connection and match, papers are all you need. I think it just summarizes the core for all applications related to academia, hh.
