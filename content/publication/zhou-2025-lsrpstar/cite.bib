Although many MAPF algorithms were developed, most of them rely on a common assumption on synchronized actions, where the actions of all agents start at the same time and always take a time unit. This assumption may limit use of MAPF planners in practice. To get rid of this assumption, recently, an algorithm called Loosely Synchronized Rule-Based Planning (LSRP) is proposed, which can find sub-optimal solutions for many agents. However, LSRP often finds poor quality solutions due to its unbounded sub-optimality. This paper develops a new anytime planner called LSRP* that can keep improving solution quality after the initial solution is obtained until the runtime budget depletes. We analyze the properties of LSPR* and test it against several baselines with up to 1000 agents in various maps. LSRP* can handle up to 25% more agents than LSRP and can reduce up to 40% of the solution cost found by LSRP.}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the International Symposium on Combinatorial Search}, author={Zhou, Shuai and Zhao, Shizhe and Ren, Zhongqiang}, year={2025}, month={Jul.}, pages={275-276} }
